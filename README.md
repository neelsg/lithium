# Lithium Programming Language

This is a little project to which I intend to contribute as and when I have time. The idea is that this should be a very general programming language that is fit for any purpose (Not likely to say the least).

## Some resources

- A quick tour [docs/tour.md](docs/tour.md).
- The language spec [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md).
- The roadmap for further development [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
- Additional documentation can be found under the [docs](docs/) folder.
