# Lithium Programming Language

This is a little project that I intend to contribute as and when I have time.
The idea is that this should be a general programming language that can fit in
just about any role from embedded IoT all the way to web scripting that compiles
into JavaScript. It should be easy to translate other languages to and from
Lithium and compilation should fairly simple into machine code for any
architecture or into other forms such as Java Bytecode or .NET CIL. If that
sounds like it is rediculously ambitious, it is because it **is** rediculously
ambitious, so I'm not very hopeful that this will ever amount to anything.

Language specifications can be found under [SPEC.md](SPEC.md)

Example code can be found under [TOUR.md](TOUR.md)
