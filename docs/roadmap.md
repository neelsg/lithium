# Lithium Programming Language Development Roadmap

This document provides a basic roadmap to follow for further development
of the Lithium Programming Language

## Goals:

| Goal                         | Status     | Description                                                                                                    |
|------------------------------|:----------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Tour complete                 |Completed   |The tour covers everything that is also covered by the tour for Go (Unless it does not apply)                   |
|Spec complete                 |Started     |The language specification covers everything that is also covered by the spec for Go (Unless it does not apply) |
|Spec and Tour aligned         |Not started |The tour and language spec is fully aligned with each other                                                     |
|Docs cover tour               |Not started |The standard library documentation covers everything listed in the tour                                         |
|Translator written in Go      |Not started |There is a translator written in Go that will translate valid Litium source code into valid Go source code      |
|Translator written in Lithium |Not started |There is a translator written in Lithium that can translate valid Lithium source code into valid Go source code |
|Command line tooling          |Not started |There are command line tools that can be used to work with Lithium such as compile, test, format etc.           |

## Compiler targets:
