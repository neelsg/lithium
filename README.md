# Lithium Programming Language

This is a little project to which I intend to contribute as and when I have time. The idea is that this should be a very general programming language that is fit for any purpose. If that sounds like it is rediculously ambitious, it is because it **is** rediculously ambitious, so I'm not very hopeful that this will ever amount to anything.

A quick tour can be found at [docs/tour.md](docs/tour.md).

The language spec can be found at [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md).

The roadmap for further development can be found at [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).

Additional documentation can be found under the [docs](docs/) folder.
